## Installation

You just install `react-giphy-selector` the good ole' fashion way through NPM:

```
npm install --save react-giphy-selector
```

## Usage

This package exports the `Selector` React component and then two helper `enums`:

```js
import {Selector, ResultSort, Rating} from "react-giphy-selector";

```

- [Selector](#selector)
- [Rating](#rating)
- [ResultSort](#resultSort)

### Selector

The selector component contains all of the search, display, and selection logic. The only required properties are `apiKey` and `onGifSelected`.

```jsx
<Selector
	apiKey={'myKey'}
	onGifSelected={this.saveGif} />
```

That said, there are a bunch of props that allow you to make this component your own. Note: the `?` included at the end of a property name denotes it as optional.

- `apiKey: string`: [Your Giphy Project API Key](https://developers.giphy.com/).
- `onGifSelected: (gifObject: IGifObject) => void`: The function to fire when a gif search result has been selected. The `IGifObject` represents the full [GIF Object](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/#gif-object) returned via the Giphy API.
- `queryFormAutoFocus?: boolean`: If you want or not the search field to be focused when the component mounts.
- `preloadTrending?: boolean`: If you want or not the component to be prepopulated with the trending gifs when it appears.
- `rating?: Rating`: The maximum rating you want to allow in your search results. Use the exported [Rating](#rating) enum for help. Default: `Rating.G`.
- `sort?: ResultSort`: The sort order of the search results. Use the helper enum [ResultSort](#resultsort). Default: `ResultSort.Relevant`.
- `limit?: number`: The number of results to return. Default: `20`.
- `suggestions?: string[]`: An array containing one-click searches to make it easy for your user. Will not show suggestions section if none are passed. Default: `[]`.
- `queryInputPlaceholder?: string`: The placeholder text for the search bar text input. Default `'Enter search text'`.
- `resultColumns?: number`: The number of columns to divide the search results into. Default: `3`.
- `showGiphyMark?: boolean`: Indicates whether to show the "powered by Giphy" mark in the selector. This is required when [using a Giphy Production API Key](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/#production-key). Default: `true`.

#### Styling your Selector

There are a bunch of `props` to help you customize the style of the the selector. Both the `className` and the `style` methods are available. `react-giphy-selector` is very intentionally unopinionated about how exactly each section of the selector should look. Instead, the package offers a lot of customization and flexibility through the props below.

The images below will help you understand the nomenclature of the components:
