## Background

> Transparency, honesty, kindness, good stewardship, even humor, work in businesses at all times.

> -- [John Gerzema](http://www.johngerzema.com/)

Companies struggle to keep everyone on the same page. People are hyper-connected in the moment but still don’t know what’s happening across the company. Employees and investors, co-founders and execs, customers and community, they all want more transparency. The solution is surprisingly simple and effective - great company updates that build transparency and alignment.

With that in mind we designed the [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) software-as-a-service application, powered by the open source [OpenCompany platform](https://github.com/open-company). The product design is based on three principles:

1. It has to be easy or no one will play.
2. The "big picture" should always be visible.
3. Alignment is valuable beyond the team, too.

Carrot simplifies how key business information is shared with stakeholders to create alignment. When information about growth, finances, ownership and challenges is shared transparently, it inspires trust, new ideas and new levels of stakeholder engagement. Carrot makes it easy for founders to engage with employees and investors, creating alignment for everyone.

[Carrot](https://carrot.io/) is GitHub for the rest of your company.

Transparency expectations are changing. Organizations need to change as well if they are going to attract and retain savvy employees and investors. Just as open source changed the way we build software, transparency changes how we build successful companies with information that is open, interactive, and always accessible. Carrot turns transparency into a competitive advantage.

## Overview

The OpenCompany Web Application provides a Web UI for creating and consuming open company content and data.

![OpenCompany Screenshot](https://open-company-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/new_homepage_screenshot.png)

### Browser Support

Latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.


## Local Setup

Prospective users of [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) should get started by going to [Carrot.io](https://carrot.io/). The following local setup is **for developers** wanting to work on the Web application.

Most of the dependencies are internal, meaning [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 8 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) - A Clojure build and dependency management tool

#### Java

Chances are your system already has Java 8+ installed. You can verify this with:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have Java 8+ [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Boot

Installing Boot is easy, for the most up to date instructions, check out the [Boot README](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install).
You can verify your install with:

```console
boot -V
```


## Usage

Prospective users of [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) should get started by going to [Carrot.io](https://carrot.io/). The following usage is **for developers** wanting to work on the Web application.

Local usage of the web application requires you to run 3 services, the [Storage service](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-storage), the [Auth service](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-auth), and the [Interaction service](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-interaction). All can be started in their respective repositiories with:

```console
lein start
```

To get an interactive web **development** environment, start the iterative compilation process in this repository:

```console
boot dev
```

If you've done it right, you'll now have 4 terminal sessions running: Storage, Auth, Interaction and Web.

Open your browser to [http://localhost:3559/](http://localhost:3559/).

To create a **production** build run:

```console
boot prod-build target
```

Open `target/public/app-shell.html` in your browser. Using production rather than dev, you will not get the live reloading nor a REPL.

To get a jetty server along with the production build:

Download the google closure compiler.
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/

```console
mkdir ~/closure_compiler
mv <download location>/compiler_latest.zip ~/closure_compiler/
cd ~/closure_compiler
unzip compiler_latest.zip
```

```console
boot dev-advanced target
```

```console
script/compile_assets.sh <compiler version> ~/path/to/open-company-web localhost:3559
cp ~/path/to/open-company-web/target/public/oc_assets.js* ~/path/to/open-company-way/resources/public/
```

### Project REPL

To have a ClojureScript REPL connected to the browser, first start the dev task:

```console
boot dev
```

If you get an error like this:

```console
clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: java.lang.RuntimeException: No such var: string/index-of, compiling:(cljs/source_map.clj:260:52)
             java.lang.RuntimeException: No such var: string/index-of
```

Make sure you have [clojure 1.7+](https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-cljs-repl#boot-cljs-repl) in build.boot, in the project boot settings [boot.properties](boot.properties) and in your local setup: `~/.boot/boot.properties`.

Next open a browser window: [http://localhost:3559/](http://localhost:3559/)

Then in another terminal window start a REPL with boot:

```console
boot repl -c
```

At this point, you can start a weasel server to connect to the browser window:

```console
cljs.user=> (start-repl)
```

If the REPL doesn't connect to the browser window, refresh the page in the browser.

At this point, you should be able to use the project's namespaces:

```console
cljs.user=> (require '[oc.web.lib.utils :as utils])
nil
cljs.user=> (utils/vec-dissoc [:a :b :c] :a)
[:b :c]
```

## Technical Design

Documentation of the technical design is [here](./docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md).


## Testing

Install [PhantomJS](https://http://phantomjs.org/) downloading the latest 2.x binary from [here](https://github.com/eugene1g/phantomjs/releases), the one from their site is currently broken.

Then move the `phantomjs` binary somewhere reachable by your `PATH` so you can run:

```console
phantomjs -v
```

Then run:

```console
boot test!
```
