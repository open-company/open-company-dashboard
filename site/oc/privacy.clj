We treat this data as non-Identifying Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. OpenCompany only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how OpenCompany Users, collectively, use our Service, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service."]
