        [:li "Companies can choose to use OpenCompany for free, but the free version does not maintain a private dashboard. The free version is for a public dashboard, which means your information can be viewed by anyone that comes to your URL, for example, https://opencompany.com/your-company-name."]
        [:li "We try to make our product easy to use, with settings and options that are easy to find and understand. This is good for privacy, good for the product, and good for OpenCompany customers and users."]]
